Description: Implements a regularized Bayesian estimator that optimizes the estimation
 of between-group coefficients for multilevel latent variable models by minimizing
 mean squared error (MSE) and balancing variance and bias. The package provides more reliable
 estimates in scenarios with limited data, offering a robust solution for accurate
 parameter estimation in two-level latent variable models. It is designed for
 researchers in psychology, education, and related fields who face challenges in
 estimating between-group effects under small sample sizes and low intraclass
 correlation coefficients. Dashuk et al. (2024) <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.18148.39048>
 derived the optimal regularized Bayesian estimator;
 Dashuk et al. (2024) <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.34350.01604> extended it to 
 the multivariate case; and Luedtke et al. (2008) <doi:10.1037/a0012869>
 formalized the two-level latent variable framework.
